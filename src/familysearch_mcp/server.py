"""MCP tool definitions over the FamilySearch API. Transport is stdio.

Docstrings and ``Field`` descriptions in this module are published as the tool
descriptions and JSON schema, so they are written for the model calling the
tool rather than for a developer reading the source.

The surface is in three parts, ordered by what an install can actually use:

- **Places.** The gazetteer answers anonymous requests, so these work with no
  credentials at all.
- **Records.** Indexed records, the images behind them, and the collections
  they sit in. This is what obtaining a token is for.
- **Tree.** The shared tree, every tool of which is registered through
  :func:`_tree_tool` so it carries :data:`TREE_CAVEAT` verbatim.

Every tool is read-only. FamilySearch's shared tree is community-edited and
conflations are common, so a result is a hint: follow it to the underlying
record and cite that.

FamilySearch moved its Historical Records API behind a login wall, so the
record routes could not be confirmed against public documentation. Each was
confirmed by live probing instead, and a comment beside the code says when.

#:   "born 1850" matched 1,676,326, of which 171,054 gave a birth year.

#:   many as "John", and "David John" too), and a place far beyond itself
#:   ("Xyzzyqq, Arkansas" found as many as "Arkansas").
#: - With exact, the field must be there and match: 17,104 born in 1850
#:   exactly; a given name as the whole name ("John" 6,017, not "John
#:   William"). A place still matches every place FamilySearch knows by
